## Recommended Approach

Create a calorie counter that:

2. Uses AI/automation to minimize manual input
3. Lives primarily in widgets/notifications

5. Removes friction at every step
6. Makes logging feel automatic, not manual

The goal: An app users open <3 times daily because logging happens automatically through widgets, voice, photos, and smart predictions.
